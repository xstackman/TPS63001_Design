## SMD Buck - Boost Converter

This are a SMD power supply with a fixed 3.3V output based on TPS63001 from Texas Instruments.
This board of 16.51 mm x 12.83 mm have only an input, output and GND terminals for a simple deployment.
This schematic was tested on several production boards, also in your implementation an efficient heat design is required.
